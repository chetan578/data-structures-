            The Line of Control separates it from the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir
             and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and north respectively, and a Line of Actual Control separates it from the Chinese-administered 
             territory of Aksai Chin in the east. The state has special autonomy under Article 370 of the Constitution of India.</p>
